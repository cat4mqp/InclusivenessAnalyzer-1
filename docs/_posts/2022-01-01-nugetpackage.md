Bias is something that can incubate inside anyone, and these biases can affect everything that we touch. As a company, Microsoft embodies inclusion as a core priority.

As of 2019, it became a vital part of the way employee reviews were conducted, and it is integral to the success of the company.

The concept of unconscious bias is not a new idea. It has been shown to affect the way we use words, the way we interact with the world, and the way people are treated in various scenarios. In the workplace, it can affect the data used in promotional reviews.
